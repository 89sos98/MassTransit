Configuration
"""""""""""""

MassTransit is configured in code. Below are a few examples that should get you
started into customizing MassTransit for your specific environment.

Basic Configuration (Singlton)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Below we can see the basic setup of MassTransit following a Bus singlton pattarn.

.. sourcecode:: csharp
    :linenos:
    
    Bus.Initialize(sbc =>
    {
        sbc.UseMsmq();
        sbc.UseMulticastSubscriptionClient();
        sbc.ReceiveFrom("msmq://localhost/test_queue");
    });

This is all you need, from there you can use `Bus.Instance` to gain access to the
bus.

The Play by Play
----------------

Line 1: Opens up the lambda

Line 3: Select the MSMQ transport

Line 4: Tells the bus to share subscription information using MSMQ multicast

Line 5: The address (MSMQ Queue) you want to receive messages on

Line 6: Close it up, its done!



Basic Configuration (Multi Instance)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you shudder at the thought of a singleton in your code, that's ok - we have
you covered too.

.. sourcecode:: csharp
    :linenos:
    
    var bus = ServiceBusFactory.New(sbc =>
    {
        sbc.UseMsmq();
        sbc.UseMulticastSubscriptionClient();
        sbc.ReceiveFrom("msmq://localhost/test_queue");
    });
