	// NOTE: Here is my sense of this. Normally this is object sender, which I find very, very confusing when trying to read the code
	// NOTE: sender could be (a) the event sender, (b) the message source, or (c) the originator
	// NOTE: So how to make that happy from a "soluability" perspective is still out there.
	// NOTE: MessageContext<T> having a method Reply(), is that something we want to do?
